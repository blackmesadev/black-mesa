# Configuration Importing
!!! note
    If you're familiar with Aperture or Rowboat, this configuration should be familiar to you!

Black Mesa's configuration file is pretty simple. You can bulk import using the bot's
`!config import` command and attaching a YML file.

## Configuration Example
```yaml
webaccess:
  206309860038410240: admin
  96269247411400704: editor
```
