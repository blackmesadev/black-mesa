## What is Black Mesa?
Black Mesa is an Aperture/<abbr title="Rowboat fork">*boat</abbr> alternative for server owners who
love configuration and micromanagement as well as performance.

Black Mesa was developed out of necessity by <abbr title="Tyler#0911">Tyler</abbr> and
<abbr title="LewisTehMinerz#1337">Lewis</abbr> from the
[Troll Discord server](https://discord.gg/troll) as Aperture was an unreliable bot at the time.
