## What is Black Mesa?

Black Mesa is an Aperture/<abbr title="Rowboat fork">\*boat</abbr> alternative for server owners
who love configuration :material-cog-outline: without compromising performance
:material-airplane-takeoff:.

## Who's behind it?

Black Mesa was developed out of necessity by <abbr title="Tyler#0911">Tyler</abbr> and
<abbr title="LewisTehMinerz#1337">Lewis</abbr> from the
[Troll Discord server](https://discord.gg/troll) as Aperture was an unreliable bot at the time.
<abbr title="Flashy#1984">Flashy</abbr> (also from Troll) joined shortly after as a web developer
to work on the web dashboard.
